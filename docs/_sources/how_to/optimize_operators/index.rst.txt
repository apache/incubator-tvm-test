    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="(TL;DR) TVM provides abstract interfaces which allows users to depict an algorithm and the algorithm&#x27;s implementing organization (the so-called schedule) separately. Typically, writing algorithm in high-performance schedule breaks the algorithm&#x27;s readability and modularity. Also, trying various seemingly promising schedules is time-consuming. With the help of TVM, we can try these schedules efficiently to enhance the performance.">

We use square size input tensors and filters as an example, and assume the input to convolution has a large batch. In this example, we use a different layout to store the data in order to achieve better data locality. The buffer layout is HWCN, which stands for height, width, channel, batch.">
