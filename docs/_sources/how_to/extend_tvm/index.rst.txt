TVM is an extensible development platform, with many points of entry to work
with, including options for bringing new datatypes and adding lower level
custom optimization passes. These how-tos describe some ways that TVM can be
extended.

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="As the number of optimization passes increases in Relay/tir, it becomes intractable to execute them and maintain their dependencies manually. Therefore, we have introduced an infrastructure to manage the optimization passes and make it applicable to different layers of the IR in the TVM stack.">
